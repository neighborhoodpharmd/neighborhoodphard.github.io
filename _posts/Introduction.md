## Why?
I recently passed working 15 years in community pharmacy, starting off as a novice pharmacy technician way back in 2006. This journey that I started as a sophmore biology major led me through college, pharmacy school, interships, and working in several states as a pharmacist. Having spent the majority of my career in community pharmacy I've become modestly skilled in certain professional areas including communication, leadership, and resiliency. I've learned many humbling lessons along the way as well, not without my fair share of trial and error and "failures." However, this blog is NOT about those experiences. It's not about continuing education or venting about work conditions either. There's plenty of other pharmacy websites that do that far better than I could.

Rather, my intention is to explore the peripheral elements of pharmacy practice: interpersonal relations, technology, culture clash, work-life balance, and self-development. These elements all factor into the gestalt of a good pharmacist and are often the practical obstacles holding back career advancement and professional growth. In other words I'm interested in what makes an otherwise competent pharmacist **useful** to their patients and society at large.

## How to be Useful...
Well, the answer to this is the mission of this blog, but here's some simple food for thought: The majority of pharmacist expertise beyond the initial phase of schooling and settling into the "staff" role or its equivalent is refinement of knowledge and technique. That's the point of continuing education and ours is the curse of a largely repetitive workday. Check prescriptions for errors, optimize patient outcomes where possible, rinse and repeat ad infinitum. If you want longevity and to stave off boredom (not to mention reduce "alert fatigue") focus on a 1% better everyday mentality.

It's not a new idea (see the Japanese concept of kaizen) and from a logistical standpoint it may not necessarily be sustainable, but it is useful for motivation and engagement. As an example, COVID vaccinations have once again highlighted pharmacists' accesibility as vaccinators. When's the last time you really honed your vaccine administration technique? Small incremental changes such as patient relaxation, body posturing, actual technique and pre and post-administration talk all factor into the shot experience. These are all moments that we probably take for granted given the sheer volume of shots that are now our responsibilty/burden, but that initial attentiveness and refinement extrapolates across hundreds of patients for a better experience both ways.

## We Can't All Be the Best

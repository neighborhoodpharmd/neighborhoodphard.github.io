subtitle: Informed commentary on pharmacy culture and digital transformation
title: About
---
I'm a community pharmacist by day, moonlighting as an aspiring health blogger. This project is a creative outlet for my observations on pharmacy and patient care in the context of digital tools, health informatics, future-proofing the profession and advocacy.

My goal is to deliver curated health information empowering patients and colleagues to think and practice in a more informed, measured and evidence-based capacity. Going along with my ethos of open information and accessibility, written works cite references whenever possible and are available under a modified creative commons license for redistribution (check the footer).

**What's in a name?** I have over *15 years* of community pharmacy experience, seven years of which have been as a pharmacy manager (since 2014). My accumulated knowledge and growing mastery *interfacing* with patients, providers, insurance, retail and everything in-between means that effective, purposeful communication is my bread and butter. What you'll find here is easy-to-read expert opinion on pharmacy services and industry influencers from a Neighborhood/[NBHD](https://www.acronymfinder.com/Neighborhood-(NBHD).html) PharmD.

subtitle: Commentary on pharmacy influencers and culture from behind-the-counter
title: About
---
I'm a community pharmacist by day, moonlighting as an aspiring technical writer and web publisher. This blog is a creative outlet for my observations on pharmacy culture and the broader medical-industrial complex. While not necessarily intended for a medical audience, I do assume basic familiarity with medical verbiage. 

That being said, my goal is to deliver curated health information empowering patients, healthcare providers, and students to think and act in a more informed, evidence-based way. Context is important and I will always provide links and recomendations so you can verify information whenever possible. This goes along with my ethos of open information and accessibility. My content is available under a modified creative commons license for redistribution. Check the footer for full information.

**Why listen to me?** I have over *15 years* of community pharmacy experience in various roles, most recently as pharmacy manager. My accumulated experience interfacing with patients, providers, insurance, retail and everything in-between means that effective communication is my bread and butter. The mission of this project is to communicate easy-to-understand expert opinion on industry developments.

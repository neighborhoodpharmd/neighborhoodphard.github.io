I'm a community pharmacist and aspiring educator. This project is a creative outlet for my observations on pharmacy practice and patient education. I have over *15 years* of community pharmacy experience, spanning pharmacy technician to pharmacist-in-charge. What you'll find here is easy-to-read expert opinion on the intersection of pharmacy practice with career mastery, productivity tools and self-improvement from a Neighborhood/[NBHD](https://www.acronymfinder.com/Neighborhood-(NBHD).html) PharmD.

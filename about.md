title: About
---
I'm a community pharmacist by day, moonlighting as an aspiring technical writer and web publisher. This blog is a creative outlet for my observations on pharmacy culture and the broader medical-industrial complex. While not necessarily intended for a technical audience, I do assume some familiarity with medical terms and current industry events.

That being said, my goal is to communicate curated health information empowering patients, healthcare providers, and students to make more informed and evidence-based medical decisions.

**Why listen to me**? I have over *15 years* of community pharmacy experience in various roles, most recently as pharmacy manager. My accumulated experience interfacing with patients, providers, insurance, retail and everything in-between combined with writing proficiency enable me to deliver human-readable expert opinion.

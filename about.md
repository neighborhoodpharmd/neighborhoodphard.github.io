subtitle: Informed commentary on pharmacy services and digital transformation
title: Neighborhood PharmD
---
I'm a community pharmacist by day, moonlighting as an aspiring technical writer and blogger. This project is a creative outlet for my observations on pharmacy culture and patient care in the context of digital transformation, health informatics, and future-proofing the profession.

My goal is to deliver curated health information empowering patients, providers, and students to think and act in a more informed, evidence-based manner. Context is important and I will always provide links and recomendations so you can verify sources whenever possible. This goes along with my ethos of open information and accessibility. My content is available under a modified creative commons license for redistribution (check the footer).

**Why listen to me?** I have over *15 years* of community pharmacy experience in various roles, most recently as pharmacy manager. My accumulated experience interfacing with patients, providers, insurance, retail and everything in-between means that effective, purposeful communication is my bread and butter. The mission of this project is to communicate easy-to-read expert opinion on pharmacy services, influencers and digital culture from **behind-the-counter**.

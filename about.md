subtitle: Informed commentary on pharmacy culture and digital transformation
title: About
---
I'm a community pharmacist by day, moonlighting as an aspiring technical writer and blogger. This project is a creative outlet for my observations on pharmacy services and patient care in the context of digital tools, health informatics, and future-proofing the pharmacy profession.

My goal is to deliver curated health information empowering patients, providers, and colleagues to think and practice in a more informed, evidence-based capacity. Context is important and I will always provide links and recomendations so you can verify sources whenever possible. This goes along with my ethos of open information and accessibility. All content is available under a modified creative commons license for redistribution (check the footer).

**What's in a name?** I have over *15 years* of community pharmacy experience, most recently as a pharmacy manager. My accumulated experience interfacing with patients, providers, insurance, retail and everything in-between means that effective, purposeful communication is my bread and butter. What you'll find here is easy-to-read expert opinion on pharmacy services, influencers and digital culture.
